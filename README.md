## My process

### Main Features

- Used [Current weather data API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to display current weather info for one city picked by a click from a dropdown list;
- Used [5 day weather forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to display 5 day weather forecast, every 3 hours by chosing one city from a dropdown list;
- Added possibility to change current city by using DOM and Event Handling concepts.
- Persisted data through localStorage. 


### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap5
- JavaScript (ES6)
- JSON
- APIs
- POSTMAN
- Netlify
- Git / GitHub

### What I learned

This is the first project created by using Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), DOM, APIs and localStorage and providing functionality to a web page.
Concepts I have learned:
- responsive design for desktop, tablet and mobile screens;
- modularization and organization of the JS code for a good understanding and clean writing;
- getting information in real time by using APIs, API key and Postman after selected one city picked by a click from a dropdown list;
- displaying information in real time for 5 day weather forecast, every 3 hours by chosing one city from a dropdown list.;
- how to make data to persist after refreshing the web browser by using localStorage;
- deploying the project on Netlify;
- creating a README.md document by learning markdown language;
